 * Drawing system allowing to display and render OSM map data in a user-friendly and customizable way, through map styles.<br>
 * Two implementations are provided:
 * <ul>
 * <li>XML: this was the system used by default JOSM map style for a long time. Kept for compatibility but not maintained anymore</li>
 * <li>MapCSS: new default system, more powerful than XML, and easier to use to write map styles. Only system maintained</li>
 * </ul>
